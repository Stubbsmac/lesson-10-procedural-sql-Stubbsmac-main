# CIS250_Create10_Procedural SQL
For this assignment you will be using a jupyter notebook to learn procedural SQL operations like stored procedures, triggers, functions, and views.

## If Something Goes Wrong
The tables that we are working with this week are created during completion of the notebook. If there is an issue, please drop the tables and run the create scripts found in the notebook to restore them. You can drop procedures, triggers, functions, and view sthe same way if needed.

## Before Starting
1. Ensure that you have completed the practice assignment succesfully.
2. Complete the Practice Jupyter Notebook assignment.
3. Complete the Module 9 Create Assignment

## Assignment Description
* The scenario will guide you through scripting all of the procedural tools above, as well as writing queries to verify that they worked as expected.
* Each of these tasks are broken up into an individual exercise that you will be able to practice and refer back to.

## Assignment Requirements
* You must write all of your scripts in the Create file and check it into github
* For full credit your scripts must return the requested result exactly
* You must use best practices in your scripts. Proper casing, spacing, and formatting are required.
* Your submitted file should show that you have -- ran -- the scripts that you are submitting.

## Tips
* When dropping tables, be mindful of if another table is dependent on the table you are trying to delete.
* When writing a large script, just write a small piece and get it working, and then continue adding and checking.
* If you get stuck, make a post in the Homework Help channel in Teams.
